HOW TO USE THE CLIENT:
The client “client.py” is made in python 3 so should by run with the command “python3 client.py”.
Before running you must make sure you have pip3 installed the package “requests” as it uses this package to send GET and POST requests.
Once the client is running you are asked to choose your option.
The correct inputs are exactly as asked in the brief:
